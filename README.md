Project Details:

Project Title: License Plate Recognition
Objective: To identify and locate license plates in vehicle images and perform character recognition.
Dataset:
Training Set 1: Vehicle images with bounding box annotations
Training Set 2: License plate images with text annotations
Test Set: Similar to Training Set 1, used for evaluating character recognition accuracy
Tools and Libraries Used:

Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook
Key Highlights:

Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow for license plate detection.
Utilized OCR techniques for character recognition on license plates.
Achieved an accuracy of 52% on the test set.
Deliverables:

Jupyter notebook with code implementation
Documentation explaining the approach and methodology
Accuracy metrics and evaluation results
