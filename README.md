Project Details:

1) Project Title: License Plate Recognition

2) Objective: To identify and locate license plates in vehicle images and perform character recognition.

3) Dataset:
 - Training Set 1: Vehicle images with bounding box annotations
 - Training Set 2: License plate images with text annotations
 - Test Set: Similar to Training Set 1, used for evaluating character recognition accuracy

4) Tools and Libraries Used:

 - Python
 - OpenCV
 - TensorFlow
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Scikit-learn
 - Pandas
 - Jupyter Notebook

5) Key Highlights:

 - Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow for license plate detection.
 - Utilized OCR techniques for character recognition on license plates.
 - Achieved an accuracy of 52% on the test set.

6) Deliverables:

 - Jupyter notebook with code implementation
 - Documentation explaining the approach and methodology
 - Accuracy metrics and evaluation results
